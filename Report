1.6	Background of the project:
This paper focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques to predict crop types and calculate their yield accurately. Various machine learning methodologies were employed to determine the accuracy of the predictions. Specifically, the Random Forest classifier was utilized to predict the suitable crops for a selected district. The implementation of a system for crop prediction based on historical data collection was accomplished. This system aims to assist farmers in making informed decisions regarding crop selection for their fields. The proposed technique provides valuable insights that enable efficient and productive harvesting practices. By accurately predicting the most suitable crops for different districts, farmers in Kerala can benefit from increased yields. Ultimately, this work contributes to the growth of the Indian economy by maximizing crop production rates.

1.7	Machine Learning in Agriculture:
This study examines a collection of publications that explore yield prediction using machine learning techniques. The selected papers employ various features based on the research scope and data availability. Each paper investigates yield prediction but differs in the specific features considered. Additionally, variations in scale, geographical location, and crop type contribute to the diversity of approaches. The selection of features is contingent upon dataset availability and research objectives. Notably, studies indicate that models with more features do not consistently outperform those with fewer features in yield prediction. To determine the best-performing model, it is crucial to test models with different feature sets. Multiple algorithms have been employed across different studies, and while no definitive conclusion can be drawn regarding the best model, certain machine learning models emerge as more commonly used. Notably, the random forest, neural networks, linear regression, and gradient boosting tree models are frequently employed. Several studies employ multiple machine learning models to assess their predictive performance. Given the prevalence of neural networks, this study also investigates the use of deep learning algorithms for crop yield prediction. Upon examining 30 relevant papers, the most utilized deep learning algorithms were found to be CNN, LSTM, and DNN. However, other algorithms have also been applied to this problem. This article serves as a foundation for further research on the development of crop yield prediction, shedding light on the current state of the field and paving the way for future advancements.

1.8	Dynamic nature of the weather vs yield:
Crop yields are heavily influenced by weather conditions, and understanding this relationship is crucial for assessing the potential impacts of climate change on the agricultural sector. Numerous studies have been conducted to model this relationship and project the effects of climate change on crop yields. In this paper, we present an innovative approach to yield modeling that combines the strengths of deep neural networks with semiparametric techniques. This approach allows us to capture complex nonlinear relationships in high-dimensional datasets while incorporating known parametric structures and accounting for unobserved cross-sectional heterogeneity. These findings emphasize the value of our novel approach in accurately capturing the complex dynamics between weather patterns and crop yields. By accounting for both parametric and nonparametric aspects, our model provides a more nuanced understanding of climate change impacts on corn yield. This has important implications for policymakers, farmers, and stakeholders involved in climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies in the agricultural sector.


CHAPTER-2: METHODOLOGY

2.1 Data Collection:
As far as data collection is concerned, gathered a comprehensive dataset containing information on crop types, years of production, quantity of production, cultivation area, cost of cultivation, and other relevant variables for agricultural crops in India from 2001-2014. Ensure the dataset covers diverse geographical regions and crop varieties. Cleaning the dataset by removing any duplicates, missing values, or outliers. Normalize or standardize numerical variables if necessary was then done. To identify any pattern or understand any inner insight of the dataset, it is important that we gather a deeper understanding by exploring it more which was then subsequently done.

2.2 Data Analysis and EDA: 
Exploratory Data Analysis Techniques need to be performed for examining the relationship between variables, identify trends, correlations, and distribution within the dataset. Visualization tools in the python language can really become handy in such cases where a deeper understanding of the dataset is required. 








To know, how the dataset is distributed within itself, a boxplot can be handy which was also used for the better understanding. 

 
Figure 1.2: Boxplot, to understand distribution
A simple plot can be used to show what crop was produced in which quantity and in what quantity.

 
Figure 2.2: Plot to understand the produce over years
It is important to understand that India has a good number of states and that too with different climatic conditions all together. Hence, a statewise understanding of what crops are cultivated and produced holds a significant importance to us. 

 
Figure 2.3: Bar graph, to understand the state-wise produce of different crops





2.3 Comparative Analysis:
It’s very important to realise that a country with more than 140+ crore people, the area vs yield of  crop has to be checked at regular intervals. Therefore, to understand this well, though there were four graphs for one financial year, a combined graph was made to showcase the Area vs Yield.

 
Figure 2.4: Area vs Yield in 2006-2007


 
Figure 2.5: Area vs Yield in 2010-2011

With the rapid increase in population over the years, a comparative study needs to be done, about how the area, yield and production have increased or decreased over the years, for every individual crop if possible. The below graphs show the pattern of increase or decrease. 

 
Figure 2.6: Production in 2006-07 vs 2010-11
 
Figure 2.7: Land utilized  in year 2006-07 vs 2010-11
  
Figure 2.8: Yield in the year 2006-06 vs 2010-11
The graphs above can also be used while understanding why the control in population is required, as there are two things that are somewhat in contrast as of today, urbanisation and growth in agriculture, because to feed a continuously growing population we need larger areas, but again because of increasing population, we need places to live. 

 
Figure 2.9: Per hectare cost of major crops
 
Figure 210: Per quintal cost of production
 
Figure 2.11: Crop yield
From the pie charts that have been displayed above, certain useful information can be drawn which include:
*Crop Cultivation-
-Sugarcane has a highest Yield in India (82.2%)
-Moong has a lowest Yield in India (0.437%)

*Cultivation cost for crop-
- Highest for sugarcane
- Lowest for moong
- Average for 'paddy, maze, cotton, wheat' etc.

*Production cost of crop-
- Sugarcane has very minimal production cost
- Moong has the highest production cost and hence, lowest yield in the country.









 
Figure 2.12: Statewise crop production, per hectare.
 
Figure 2.13: State-wise, production cost, per quintal
The need of these pie chart is to gather the information at a root level, which can help us tell someone, which crop can be an alternative source of income/cultivation for the farmers. In the current times, nobody should rely on a single source of income. 
*State-wise agricultural observations-
- Karnataka is the highest in yield.
- Odisha is least in yield.
- Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra spend maximum in cultivation as well in production cost for agriculture.
- Bihar and West Bengal spends very less in cultivation as well in production cost for agriculture.
